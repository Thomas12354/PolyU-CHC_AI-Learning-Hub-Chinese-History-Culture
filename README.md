# PolyU-CHC_AI-Learning-Hub-Chinese-History-Culture
This repository serves as a  AI Learning Hub focused on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Chinese History and Culture. It is a collaborative project under the PolyU Chinese History and Culture (CHC) initiative, aiming to support researchers, students, and educators in exploring how emerging AI technologies can contribute to the humanities, especially in the context of Chinese historical studies.

📚 Repository Contents
The repository includes:

Research papers and review articles in PDF format

• Resources on applying AI and Machine Learning to Chinese history, culture, language, and digital humanities

• Case studies and academic findings related to AI-driven analysis in historical and cultural contexts

📌 Purpose
This project aims to:

• Encourage interdisciplinary research across AI and the humanities

• Provide accessible learning materials for those interested in AI applications in cultural studies

• Build a bridge between technological innovation and traditional scholarship

🎥 Relevant Learning Videos
